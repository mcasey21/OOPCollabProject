# OOPCollabProject
This was a project me and my friends done, we were learning OOP in python so we decided to curate this text based murder mystery game

This game includes a short story about the situation at hand.
You play a detective on a yacht. You start off in the main foyer
of the ship, from there you have to traverse the ship to find clues
and hints to who may be the killer! There is a notebook that 
includes stuff you may need to find the killer. Once all the clues
are found you get to make a guess, you only have one guess so 
dont screw it up!
